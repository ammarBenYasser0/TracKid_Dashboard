## About the application

Over 100,000 people around the world are missing, which has created a global "crisis,'' the International Committee of the Red Cross said . Always when we are faced with news like this, we start to think about the obstacles they face, imagine what you would do if one of your relatives got into a situation like this, what you would do to save him. Let me tell you about the obstacles that the disappeared person face; few are exposed to death (murder), rape or abasement. People who care about a missing person such as parents, friends, and relatives experience stress and anxiety about not knowing if the missing person is alive or dead. So we believe that Children or any person missing is a major issue and we as a society have to resolve it. For that purpose, we decided to make a system that will help to find missing persons by face recognition and make it more accurate and smart by applying Machine learning .

In our system, the photo of the person given by the relatives at the time of his loss is stored in the database. The public is given the authority to upload photos of anyone in uncertain situations. The match of this image will be automatically detected between the images already in the database by our application. This helps the police department/ the relatives to find the missing person anywhere.

When the public notices someone they thought he/she may be kidnapped or lost, they can take a picture of him/her and upload it to our application. after uploading the application system will start searching for a similar image. if the system detects the person, then the system will notify his/her registered relatives. In case the system couldn't detect the person as it's not been recorded before in the database, then the system will consider it as a new record.

In this way, it reduces the time spent searching for a person's details after finding them. Sometimes a person is missing for an extended period of time. The age gap is reflected in the picture as aging affects the structure of the face, including shape, texture, etc. A person's appearance can vary due to aging, filters, posture, lighting, etc. All these factors were considered before choosing a face recognition algorithm.
